## Steel man: a recommender system for opposing opinions
*An Antidote to polarization*

### Overview
In the aftermath of the 2016 election and Brexit it is clear that polarization has increased in western society. That is, people tend to group with those ideologically similar to them, while engaging in discourse that predominantly supports their own perspectives. The impacts of this ideological distance include a divergence of attitudes, toward extremes, and a lack of common ground - even to the point where people of differing political parties cannot understand one another. 

Social media platforms and their recommender systems have been largely blamed for this phenomenon by algorithmically curating content based on readers interests and leaving out alternative perspectives. This phenomenon has been referred to as echo chambers, filter bubbles, media diets, and selective exposure. 

It’s actually hard to find an uncurated news feed these days even beyond social media - when I open my phone apple news shows me articles based on my interests, if I google a topic the algorithm shows me what it thinks I am looking for. Even the New York Times has implemented a “my feed” option to their digital news app.  

We need to understand opposing viewpoints, not just to mitigate unhealthy polarization in society but in order to solve problems we must weave together ideas from a range of perspectives. In philosophy a common idea is that to be an effective debator and thinking one must utilize the "steel man" argument. The steel man requires a debater to find the best form of the opposing argument and then argue with this rather than the “straw man” which is a caricature utilized to undermine the opposition. In the words of John Stuart Mill, “He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.”

### Goal
My goal for this project is to create an antidote to echo chambers and subsequent polarization by creating a recommender system that gives the reader an alternative opinion to the content they are reading on the same topic. The end product would be to have an app where a reader inputs a url to an article and the recommender system will suggest editorials that will challenge the opinion of that article.
